## A Small Project That Took Off

This project started as a simple school assignment, but I decided to take it a step further. What began as a basic flight simulation quickly became a personal challenge to push my programming skills and experiment with physics-based movement.

I also took the opportunity to model my own aircraft, a *F-22 Raptor*, using Blender. It’s not a perfect replica, but it gets the job done!

## How It Works

Rather than relying on basic transformations, the plane's movement is driven by physics. The ailerons, rudder, flaps, and elevators all contribute to the way the aircraft handles, making the flight experience more dynamic and realistic.

The controller supports both **keyboard & mouse** and **gamepad input**, with gamepad controls being the most optimized way to fly. 

## Testing Grounds

To test everything, I quickly put together a simple environment using Unity’s terrain tools. It features a basic **flight circuit**, which helped me fine-tune the controls and physics.

## The Goal Behind This

This project was never meant to be anything to be released as a product. It was more of a **personal challenge** than anything else. I wanted to see how well I could implement a physics-based aircraft controller while putting some **math** and **logic** into practice.

If you find it useful, feel free to clone the [repository](https://github.com/oscar30gt/PlanePhysicsSimulator) and use it in your own projects. No restrictions: just take it, modify it, and see what you can create.

*Not everything has to be a big, serious project. Sometimes, just having fun and experimenting is the best way to learn!*
