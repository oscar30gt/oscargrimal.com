When working on multiple projects, thereâ€™s always that **one** thing that gets repetitive. For me, it was setting up the same **React TSX component template** every time I created a new file in VS Code. It was a small but constant friction pointâ€”so I decided to fix it.  

Thatâ€™s how **Code Templates** was born.  

## What Is Code Templates?  

**Code Templates** is a VS Code extension that allows you to define **default content** for new files based on their extension. Instead of manually pasting code every time you create a new `.tsx`, `.py`, or `.cpp` file, Code Templates does it for you.  

Once set up, every new file you create will start with the exact structure you needâ€”saving time and making development smoother.  

## How It Works  

1. **Install the Extension** from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Oscargt.quick-start-templates).  
2. **Define Templates** for specific file extensions.  
3. **Create a New File**â€”the template is automatically applied.  

Itâ€™s that simple. No more copy-pasting the same snippets over and over again. I plan to add some new functionalities in the future.

## Get It Now  

You can **download Code Templates** directly from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Oscargt.quick-start-templates) and start using it today. If you find it useful, let me knowâ€”feedback and ideas are always welcome!  

Small tool, big difference. ðŸš€
